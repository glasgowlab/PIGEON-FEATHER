HDX/MS
======

Hydrogen deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) is a 
powerful technique that links protein structure, dynamics, and function 
by measuring mass changes resulting from the exchange between a proteinâ€™s
backbone amide hydrogens and deuterium in a D2O buffer. This exchange 
rate is affected by the protein's folded state, dynamics, and the chemical
properties of its amino acid sequence, particularly hydrogen bonding
stability in the protein backbone and solvent accessibility. HDX-MS has
thus been employed to study protein conformational dynamics. 


However, HDX data are typically used qualitatively due to their peptide-level 
resolution. As such, a computational method to calculate accurate H-D exchange 
rates at single-residue resolution would be extremely valuable. These 
rates can be converted into protection factors (PFs), which represent the 
equilibrium constant in the local folding-unfolding process of a backbone 
amide and can be used to calculate the change in free energy for unfolding at 
each residue. PFs derived from HDX experiments are therefore key energetic 
features of a protein ensemble.

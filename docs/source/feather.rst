FEATHER
=======

FEATHER (xx) is a method to determine PFs at residue resolution 
using medium resolution HDX/MS datasets using a Bayesian approach by 
doing isotopic mass envelope fitting.


Why we need high resolution PFs
-------------------------------

The high resolution PFs are needed for the following reasons:

- Proection factors (PFs) are equilibrium constant of the local unfold process of protein backbonea amides.

- PFs is a way to define FEL
